# Marginal Distributions
let (X, Y) be a couple of random variables with joint pdf f(x,y). if X and Y are discrete, then the marginal pdf of X and Y are defined by:

if X and Y are continuous, the the marginal pdf of X and Y are defined by:

# Independence
Two variables X and Y are independent iff 
$$\huge f(x,y)=f_X(x)*f_Y(y)$$
**for every combination of `x` and `y`**
ie. iff the joint pdf is equal to the product of the marginal distributions
