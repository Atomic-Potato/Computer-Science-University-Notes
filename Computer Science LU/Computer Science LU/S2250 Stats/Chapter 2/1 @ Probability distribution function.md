# Definition
A random variable is discrete if it takes a finite or countably (enumerable, for example the set of positive integers) infinite number of values.
The set of values taken by a random variable `X` is denoted `S(X)`
`X=x` x is the value taken by X is an **event**

# The probability distribution function (PDF)
The `PDF` its a listing of all the values taken by x and their respective probabilities
example:

**Property**
The sum of the probability of all the values taken by a random variable is `1`

**Reminder**

# Cumulative distributive function (CDF)
The cdf of a random variable is defined by

continuation of the previous example:

The PDF and the CDF of a random variable of X are related by the formula:
`f(x) = F(X) - F(X-1)`
