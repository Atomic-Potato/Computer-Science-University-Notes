# Mean of a random variable
The `mean` (expected value, average) of a discrete random variable, denoted `E(X)`, is defined by:

The expectation of `g(X)`, where g is "any" function, is defined by:

`E(X)` is a special case for  `g = id (g(x)= x)`

# Mean of a function of random variable
### Linearity of E(X)
if `X` is a discrete random variable, with `pdf f(x) = P(X=x)` then:

# Variance of a random variable
### Defining Formula
The `variance` measures the average distance from a value of `x` to the `mean`
The variance of X, denoted `Var(X) (or sigma squared)` is defined by:

### Computing formula
The variance of X, can be computed by the formula:

### Properties for the variance
if X is a discrete random variable, then
- Var(X) >= 0; moreover Var(X) = 0 iff X = E(X)
- Var(aX + b) = (a^2)Var(X)
