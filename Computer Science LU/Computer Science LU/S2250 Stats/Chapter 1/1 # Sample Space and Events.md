# Sample space
A sample space, denoted S, is the collection of all outcomes when an experiment is performed

# Events
An event is a set of outcomes form the sample space. The events are usually denoted A,B,C,....
If we regard S as a set, then an event is a subset of S

## Operations on events
- The union of two events A and B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set of all outcomes that are either in A or in B
- The intersection of two events A and B, denoted A ∩ B, is the set of all outcomes that are both in A and in B
-  The complement of an event A, denoted A, is the set of all outcomes that are not in A

## Mutually exclusive events
Two events A and B are disjoint iff A ∩ B = ∅
The events A 1 ,A 2 ,A 3 ,... are mutually exclusive if and only if:
$$A i ∩ A j = ∅ , i != j$$
