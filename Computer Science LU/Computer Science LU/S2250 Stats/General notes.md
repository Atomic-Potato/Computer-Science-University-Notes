You can consider in the questions that `and = intersect` and `or = union` 

When the second action depends on the first action, we use bayes rule

Uniform = discrete, else continuous

- Factor the denominator $\huge ax^2+bx+c$
	- find `u and v` such that $\huge u*v=c$ and $\huge u+v=b$
	- then it will get factored into $\huge (\sqrt{a}x+u)(\sqrt{a}x+v)$ 
- Then you get the equation $\huge \frac{num}{(\sqrt{a}x+u)(\sqrt{a}x+v)} = \frac{A}{(\sqrt{a}x+u)} + \frac{B}{(\sqrt{a}x+v)}$ 
- then you multiply both sides with the factored denominator and you give a value to `x` such that it will cancel A or B then you find A or B and then do the same for the other one.

`If the integral goes below the domain of x then the integral just becomes 0 and if it goes over the domain then it becomes 1`

## Chain rule
$\huge f(g(x))' = f'(g(x))g'(x)$

## General reminders
- $\huge u^x = e^xln(u)$ 
- $\huge \int e^{-ax} = -\frac{1}{a}e^{-ax}$  
- $\frac{d}{dx}e^u = u'e^u$
