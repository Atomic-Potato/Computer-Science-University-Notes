A good tip in this is to draw the questions on paper

n is the population and k is the amount of people in a group

# Combination
A selection of `k` objects out of `n` objects without repetition and without order, denoted `(n k) n choose k` or `C^k and C_n (the binomial formula)`
$$\binom{n}{k} \space = \space \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
# Permutation
A selection of `k` objects out of `n` objects without repetition and `with order`. Denoted

**Permutation of distinct objects**
The number of permutations of `n distinct` objects is `n!`
`Note: if all n objects are the same then the number of permutations is = 1`

**Basic counting rule**
if an experiment has `n1` outcomes, and another experiment has `n2` outcomes, then the total number of outcomes is `n1 x n2`

**Permutation of indistinguishable objects**
The number of permutations of `n` objects, from which `n1` are the same, `n2` are the same, ...., and `nk` are the same, with
`n1+n2+...+nk = n` is:
$$\frac{n!}{(n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)}$$
