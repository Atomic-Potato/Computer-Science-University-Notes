# Definitions
**`Def 1:`**
Let (A,+,.), (B,+,.) are two rings and f : A --> B is a mapping. We say that f is ring homomorphism if for every x,y ∈ A, we have: $$f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \space and \space f(x.y) = f(x).f(y)$$
**`Kernel:`**
$$ker(f) = \{x ∈ A/ : f(x) = 0_B \}$$
**`Image:`**
$$Im(f) = \{f(x)/ : x ∈ A\}$$
**`Def 2:`**
Let f : A −→ B be a ring homomorphism.
-  If f is `bijective` then we say that f is `isomorphism`.
-  If `G = G'` then in this case f is said to be `endomorphism`.
-  If `G = G'` and f is bijective then f is said to be `automorphism`.
# Propositions
**`Prop 1:`**
Let f : A −→ B be a non zero ring homomorphism then
- $f(0_A) = 0_B$
- $f(-x) = -f(x) ∀x ∈ G$
-  If B is integral and 1 A ,1 B exist then $f(1_A ) = 1_B$ . In addition we have $f(x^{−1} ) = f(x)^{−1} ,∀x ∈ U(A)$

**`Prop 2:`**
*ker(f)* is and ideal of A and *Im(f)* is subring of B

**`Prop 3:`**
Let f : A −→ B be a ring homomorphism then
- f is injective, if and only if, $ker(f) = \{0_A \}$
-  f is surjective, if and only if, $Im(f) = B$
