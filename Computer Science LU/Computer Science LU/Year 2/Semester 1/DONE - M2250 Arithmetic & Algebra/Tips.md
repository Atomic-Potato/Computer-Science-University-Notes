- When asked to prove that subset is `integral commutative unitary ring` then it suffices to prove that this subset is a `subring` from its parent.
  
- When proving a `normal` subset we take a `z` in `xNx^-1` and we take a `y` in `N` and we work with what we got, sometimes removing the `x` and `x^-1` gets the job done.
  
- lets say x belongs to set if `x = a cong b(2)`, then to use this you can manipulate the equation `a cong b(2)` to get something in return like a `0 bar` by just adding b to each term, `a + b cong 2b(2) cong 0(2)` (since any multiple of 2 is 0)
  
- when you see a `GCD = 1` a lot of the times its proven by `Bezoutâ€™s identity`
  
- If you are required to prove an equation with multiple variables, remember than you can get rid of one of the variables by converting the equation to `mod n` with `n` being the coefficient of one of the variables, its also easier to take the one with smaller coefficient sometimes
