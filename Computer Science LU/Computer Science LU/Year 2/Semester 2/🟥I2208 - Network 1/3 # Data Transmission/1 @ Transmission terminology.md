# Data VS Signal
- `Data` – information formatted/stored in human/machine readable. ^data
- `Signal` – electric or electromagnetic representation of data
	transmission media work by conducting energy along a physical path; thus, to be transmitted, data must be turned into energy in the form of electro-magnetic signals ^signal
- `Transmission` – communication of  data through  propagation d and  processing  of signals

**`Note:`** To be transmitted, data must be transformed to electromagnetic signals.

# Transmission Terminology
- Data transmission occurs between `transmitter` and `receiver` over some **transmission medium**.
- Communication is in the form of `electromagnetic waves`.
	- [[2 @ Guided media (wired)|Guided media]]: twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber.
	- [[3 @ Unguided media (wireless)|Unguided media]]: air, vacuum, seawater.

# Amplitude, Frequency and Phase
Time domain concepts
- `Analog Signal` (Continuous signal): Signal intensity **varies smoothly with no breaks.** ^analogSignal
- `Digital Signal` (Discrete signal): Signal intensity maintains **a constant level** and then **abruptly changes to another level** ^digittalSignal
- `Periodic Signal`: Singla pattern **repeats over time**^periodicSignal
- `Aperiodic Signal`: Pattern  **not repeated over time**^aperiodicSignal

# Analog and Digital
Data can be `analog` or `digital`. 
The term `analog` data refers to information that is **continuous**. ^andlogData

`Digital` data refers to information that has **discrete** states. ^digitalData

**Analog** data take on **continuous** values. **Digital** data take on **discrete** values.

*[[1 @ Transmission terminology#^signal|signals]] can be analog or digital.
Analog signals can have an infinite number of values in a range; digital signals can have only a limited number of values.*

**a.** *For example: sin x, sin 2x, x+3, …*
**b.** *For example: sign(x), any other function that has finite values for all x intervals.*
