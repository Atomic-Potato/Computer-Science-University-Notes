# Substitution and Instances
- A `substitution Ïƒ` is a finite set $\large \color{cyan} (V_i /t_i )$ or $\large \color{cyan} (V_i \space by \space t_i )$ where each $V_i$ is a variable, each $t_i$ is a [[ðŸŸ©1 @ Predicate Logic#Terms|term]] different of $V_i$ and none of the element of this set has the same variable $V_i$ ^substitution
*For example: Ïƒ = {X/a,Y/f (g(a)),Z/g(T)}*
- Let Ïƒ be a substitution, E an expression. The expression obtained by replacing simultaneously all the occurrence of $V_i$ by $t_i$ for all i is noted $E_Ïƒ$ and called the `instance` of E. ^instance
*For example: , E = P(X,Y) âˆ¨ Q(g(X),Z), Ïƒ = {X/f (a),Y/g(T),Z/T} then $E_Ïƒ$ = P(f (a),g(T)) âˆ¨ Q(g(f (a)),T)*
- **Forbidden substitutions**: constant/anything, X/f(X) (variable by a function), function/anything

The `composition` of Î¸ and Ïƒ (noted Ïƒ â—¦ Î¸) is the substitution obtained form

Basically you first apply the substitution theta and then you apply the substitution sigma. Note that its not commutative and its not the same the other way around.
