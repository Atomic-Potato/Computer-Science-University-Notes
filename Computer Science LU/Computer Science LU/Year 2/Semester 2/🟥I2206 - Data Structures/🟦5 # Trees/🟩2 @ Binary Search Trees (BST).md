In this kind of tree all the the `left subtree` elements data should be **less** than the `root` data and the `right subtree` elements data should be **greater** than the root data.

This can help us reduce the time complexity from `O(n) to O(log(n))`

# Some notes on BSTs
- Preforming [[ðŸŸ©1.1 @ Binary Trees Traversals#Inorder LDR Traversal| inorder traversal]] on BSTs produces a sorted list
- While solving problems on BSTs, only the intermediate step (processing root data) changes
- BSTs consider either left or right subtrees for searching but not both 
- Adding an element to a BST -->  adding an element to one of its leaves
