Filtering technique is a process used to restore the original image by removing noise from the noisy image.

Causes of noise are:
- Sensor heat
- Poor transmission
- Memory failure

A noisy image can be modeled as:
$$\large \color{cyan} n(x,y)= o(x,y) + b(x,y)$$where
- `n:` noisy image
- `o:` original image
- `b:` noise

## Gaussian
The histogram of the noisy image has the form of Gaussian distribution

# Spatial Filtering
Spatial filtering changes pixelâ€™s intensity according to the intensities of its neighbors.

## Linear filtering: Average
We use this equation:
$$\large \color{cyan} F = K (*) N$$
Where:
- `F`: filtered image
- `K`: Kernel, mask or filter.
- `N`: Noisy image
- `(*)`: Convolution operator

A kernel is usually a 3\*3 matrix

So its like $\large \color{cyan} F(i,j)=sum(sum(K(u,v)*N(i+u,j+v)))$ 
The first sum adds each entry with its equivalent in position in the second row
Second sum adds all entries of the matrix

Each pixel in the output image contains the average value in a 3-by-3 neighborhood (kernel size) around the corresponding pixel in the input image.

- **Implementation of `(*)`:**
	- the elementwise multiplication: `.*`
	- The function sum

*Example:*
```matlab
W=[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9];
K=[1 1 1;1 1 1;1 1 1]/9;
R=sum(sum(W.*K))
```

## Non-linear Filtering: Median
Replace each pixel in the noisy image with the median of its neighbors.
- create the corresponding window `N(i-1:i+1, j-1:j+1)`
- sort values
- get the middle

Each pixel in the output image contains the median value in a 3-by-3 neighborhood (window size)around the corresponding pixel in the input image.
