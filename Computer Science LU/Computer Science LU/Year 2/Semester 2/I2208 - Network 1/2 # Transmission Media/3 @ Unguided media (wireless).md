It carries electromagnetic signals representing binary digits using radio or microwave frequencies. This provides the greatest mobility option.

Some of the limitations of wireless:
- **Coverage area** - Effective coverage can be significantly impacted by the physical characteristics of the deployment location.
- **Interference** - Wireless is susceptible to interference and can be disrupted by many common devices.
- **Security** - Wireless communication coverage requires no access to a physical strandof media, so anyone can gain access to the transmission.
- **Shared medium** - WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time. Many users accessing the WLAN simultaneously results in reduced bandwidth for each user.

# Microwaves
- Electromagnetic waves having frequencies between 1 and 300Ghz are called Microwaves.
- Microwave propagation is line-of-sight. Since the towers with the mounted antennas need to be in direct sight of each other.
- Very high-frequency MW cannot penetrate walls.
- The MW band is relatively wide, almost 299 Ghz.
	 Therefore wider subbands can be assigned, and a high data rate is possible.

## Repeaters
To increase the distance served by terrestrial microwave, a system of repeaters can be installed with each antenna.
