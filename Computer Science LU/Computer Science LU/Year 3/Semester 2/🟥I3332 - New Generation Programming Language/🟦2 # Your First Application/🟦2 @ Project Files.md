# The `csproj` project file: defining your dependencies
It contains the details required for the .NET tooling to build your project.

It defines the type of project being built *(web app, console app, or library)*, which platform the project targets *(.NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, and so on)*, and which NuGet packages the project depends on.

# The Program class: building a web host
Main uses a `IHostBuilder`, created by the call to `CreateDefaultBuilder`, to define how the `IHost` is configured, before instantiating the `IWebHost` with a call to `Build()`.
