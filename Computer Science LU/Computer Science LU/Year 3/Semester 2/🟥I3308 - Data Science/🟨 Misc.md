# Definition Query
Definition queries allow you to define a subset of features to work within a layer by filtering which features are retrieved from the dataset by the layer. 
This means that a definition query affects not only drawing, but also which features appear in the layer's attribute table and can be selected, labeled, identified, and processed by geoprocessing tools. 
_(Basically a filtering tool)_

To make a query, just simply right click the layer and go to `Properties` and you can create it in the `Definition Query` Section
