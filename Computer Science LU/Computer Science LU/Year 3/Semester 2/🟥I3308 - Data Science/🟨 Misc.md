# Definition Query
Definition queries allow you to define a subset of features to work within a layer by filtering which features are retrieved from the dataset by the layer. 
This means that a definition query affects not only drawing, but also which features appear in the layer's attribute table and can be selected, labeled, identified, and processed by geoprocessing tools. 
_(Basically a filtering tool)_

To make a query, just simply right click the layer and go to `Properties` and you can create it in the `Definition Query` Section

# Attachments
In here we will see how to include images and various media in a feature class.

First enable attachments by going to the `Properities` of the feature class -> `Manage` -> `Attachments`

This will create a table that contains the attachments and a [[ðŸŸ©4@ Tabular Data Associations#Creating Relationship Classes|relationship class]] between the attachments table and the original feature class.

And now simply to add an attachment to a field, you go to the attribute table of the layer and right click the field -> `Manage Attachements`
