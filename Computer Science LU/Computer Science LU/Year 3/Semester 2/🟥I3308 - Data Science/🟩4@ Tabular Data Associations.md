# Relate
A relate is a temporary relationship between two tables or feature classes based on a common field. When you perform a relate, you combine the attribute data from two tables or feature classes into a single output table or feature class. This allows you to query, analyze, and display the combined data as if it were a single dataset. However, the original data in the input tables or feature classes remains unchanged.

# Join
A join is a relationship between two tables or feature classes based on a common field, but it is not a temporary relationship like a join. Instead, a join establishes a permanent link between the two datasets, so that changes to one dataset are reflected in the other. When you perform a join, you create a table that shows the joined records from one dataset for each record in the other dataset.

# Join VS Relate
The main difference between join and relate is that a [[#Relate]] creates a temporary relationship between two datasets that does not change the original data, while a [[#Join]] creates a permanent relationship that does change the original data.
 
**==Note:==** **I THINK ITS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE, TOO LAZY TO EXPERIMENT BUT YOU GET THE GIST OF THESE RELATIONS**
