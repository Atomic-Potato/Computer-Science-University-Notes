> A DFA consists of a finite set of states, an input alphabet, a transition function, a start state, and a set of accepting states. The key characteristic of a DFA is that for every state in the machine and for every input symbol, there is exactly one transition defined. This means that the next state of the machine is uniquely determined by the current state and the input symbol. As a result, a DFA accepts or rejects an input string based on whether it reaches an accepting state or not after reading the entire input.

> NFA allows for multiple transitions from a given state on the same input symbol, and it can also have Îµ-transitions, which are transitions that don't consume any input. This non-determinism gives an NFA more flexibility in its behavior compared to a DFA. An NFA accepts an input string if there is at least one path from the start state to an accepting state that can be traversed by following the transitions and consuming the input symbols.

> Also remember that in a given word, at least one of the paths leads to the accepted state. What i mean is you have multiple choices of paths with a sequence, if theres a path using that sequence that leads to the accepted state then it is an accepted word.

> To do the simplification directly from the table, instead of just listing all the states and find their transitions, we just add new states when a transition leads to a new state

> If you truncate a language *(that is remove the last character from each word)*, then for the truncated language to be regular, all you have to do is set the accepted states to be the one before the last ones of the original language
