15 regular language

ch1 :2
ch2 : 
- 4th M accept w  --- p.8 ~9 (exo gievn)
- 5th DFA NFA , prob of concat , NFA --> goes through all options  like a thread
NFA : Considers all options --> don't care alot , sink state (not used in DFA) 
--> multiple choice 

DFA : more deterministic and strict , get to accept state at any cost for all cases treated the same 
--> one deterministic path that gets it to what we want

- 6th , Conversion from NFA to DFA @15:30
- 7th more exercises
- 8th more exercises
- 9th  more exercises , convert NFA to DFA , algorithm to minimize DFA
- 10th exercices on Minimization + new ch 2

CH 2 : Regular expression @vid10 54m
gonna skip to 17 according to group


CH: 3 CFG @vid 17 
-17th CFG
-18th CNF : normalization of a CFG to try to get away from ambiguity , CFG into CNF CFG , exp3 p.3 is exo @1h6m
- 19th  exp3 p.3 exercices

# What's Required
## Chap 2
**Questions that he said will be in the exam** 
1) transform a language from descriptive to regular or vice versa (i think it means via regular expressions)
2) given a dfa (figure ) give M (5 tuples ) or the language 
   Or given language  draw the dfa (with M )
3) draw nfa that correspondence to certain language
4) given a NFA give the language
5) convert nfa to dfa (show work by **constructive** method) 


**Notes he said in class:** 
- any language can be written in descriptive or as a regular expression 
- a regular language can be written as a regular expression 


**Parts excluded from the chapter:** 
- minimization using any method guessing or triangular

## Chap 3
**Questions in exam** 
- Given a language L try to find the context free grammar 

**Excluded from the chapter:**
- The tree 
- chomesky normal form and the method to get it 

**==Note:==**
- focus on the exercise given in class that give the CFG of a language

# Things to do
- go more in depth in languages operations, like union and shit
