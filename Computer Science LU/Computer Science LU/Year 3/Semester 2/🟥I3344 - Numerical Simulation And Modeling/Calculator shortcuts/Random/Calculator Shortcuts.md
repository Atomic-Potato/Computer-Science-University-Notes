>For all of these shortcuts, you need to fill a table like so *(except for matrices)*:
>Mode -> 3: STAT -> 2: A+BX
>Fill the table
>![[Pasted image 20230709175721.png]]
>Press `AC` once done

---

# SEE a0 and a1
1. SHIFT + 1
2. 5: Regression
3. A is a0 and B is a1

# $\hat{y}$
1. SHIFT + 1
2. 5: Regression
3. 5: $\hat{y}$

this will output $\hat{y}$ on the screen
![[Pasted image 20230709180228.png]]
now you can put to the left of it the value of x,
and if you press equal, it will output the result of $\hat{y}$ on that x

# Mean Value
1. SHIFT + 1
2. 4: Var

This will give you several options, what you want is the `5:` $\bar{y}$  and `4:` $\bar{x}$

# Sum
1. SHIFT + 1
2. 3: Sum

![[Pasted image 20230709180722.png]]
This will give you a list of sum options of x and y that you filled in the table

# Matrix operations
## Filling out the matrices
1. MODE  -> 6
2. MatA
3. Fill MatA and press AC once done
4. Repeat 1 to 3 for MatB

## Operations
- Add a matrix to the screen by pressing SHIFT + 4 and select the desired matrix
  ![[Pasted image 20230709181848.png]]
  - Add an operation between each matrix
