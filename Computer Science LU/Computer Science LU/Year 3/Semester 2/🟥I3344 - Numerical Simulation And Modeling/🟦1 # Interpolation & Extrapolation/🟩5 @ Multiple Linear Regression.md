# Choosing The Predictors
Some predictors affect the prediction value more than others,
some make it more accurate,
and some increase the error

## First Method : *Combination*

## Second Method : *Direct Selection*

In this method we adjust the R^2 depending on how many predictors we have and if they benefit us or nah, this will result in the R^2 becoming like the following:
