# Finite Element Methods
To approximate the value of an integral I we gonna use the following formula:

To Solve This Formula, the following methods are possible:

# Monte Carlo Integration
> Couldnt really find where he solves anything on this, so ig its not that important.
> But its probably used just like the [[#Finite Element Methods]]
