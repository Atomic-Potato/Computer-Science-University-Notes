3. Image Synthesis
	- Image synthesis is the process of artificially generating images that contain some particular desired content
4. Advanced Algorithms
5. Circuits Advanced Logic
6. Numerical Simulation and Modelling
	- A numerical simulation is **a calculation that is run on a computer following a program that implements a mathematical model for a physical system**. Numerical simulations are required to study the behavior of systems whose mathematical models are too complex to provide analytical solutions, as in most nonlinear systems.
