_Next:_ [[ðŸŸ©2 @ Syntax]]

`PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)` is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be usedÂ **to develop dynamic and interactive websites**. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data.
The PHP syntax vaguely resembles that of the C language. Instructions located in the `<?php .... ?>`

To use `PHP` you have to install `Wamp` or that other thing that idk. Just follow an indian youtuber to see how it all works.
