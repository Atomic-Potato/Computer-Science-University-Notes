# Mails
To send mail in PHP, use `mail()` which uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol _(SMTP)_
```php
// mail(to_address, subject, message, extra_headers);

// Example:
$dest = "orders@hardwareville.com";
$subject = "New Hardware Order";
$message = "Enclosed is a new order for 12 hammers.\n Thanks.";
$extra = "From: harry@hardwareville.com";
mail($dest,$subject,$message,$extra);
```
