If the memory is full & I need to load a new page into the memory, I need to evict a page in the memory to replace it with the new one.

In a nutshell, these are the steps taken:
1. Know which page I need to evict
2. If it has been modified, write it back to disk
3. Load the new page into memory

Eviction types:
- `Local:` to evict the pages that are related to this process
- `Global:` to evict pages with respect to the whole memory _(Our course of study)_

We have multiple "global" algorithms to help us decide which page to evict, that we shall see next.

_Before continuing, heres some **terminology**:_
```
- Reference String: the memory reference sequence generated by a program
	For example: The pages of this program will be referenced in the following order:
				 A,B,C,D,A,B,E,A,B,C,D,E
- Fault: A page fault is when the page references a virtual address that is not in memory
- Paging: moving pages to/from disk
- Optimal: best (theoretical) strategy
- Eviction: throwing something out
```

# Random Algorithm
uh... i pick, umm... that page!!

# Optimal Algorithm
_(This algorithm is theoretical and not used, its just used for reference)_

This algorithm assumes that we know the future reference string for a program. And it would choose the page with the last reference in the future.

## How the hell do i read this table?
_Page Refs_ is the reference string / the order the pages are referenced in.
_3 Page Frames_ means that the size of the memory is 3 Frames
_Fault?_ means if the page is not in memory
_Page Contents_ are the pages loaded into memory

You read the table row by row. 
First A arrives, its not in memory, then its added to the memory.
Second B arrives, its not in memory, then its added to the memory.
Third C arrives, its not in memory, then its added to the memory.
**Fourth D arrives, its not in memory, then the algorithm kicks in.**

# FIFO Algorithm
First page in -> first page out.

_(9 faults)_

## Belady's Anomaly
As the number of page frames increases, the number of faults increases

_(12 references, 10 faults)_

# Last Recently Used Algorithm
This algorithm keeps track of the time each page was accessed in and evicts the least used page _(lowest access time)_

# According To Number of References & Dirty Bit Algorithm
- `Reference bit:` increases every time the page is read or written
- `Dirty bit:` set when page is written to

This algorithm removes the page that is least referenced _(R=0)_ & not written to _(d = 0)_ _(else the one with R=0 & D=1, else R=1 & D = 0â€¦)_

Cases in order of eviction priority:

# Second Chance Algorithm
This algorithm is based on FIFO & Reference.

The algorithm:
```c
Look at the oldest page:
	Reference bit is 0:
		remove it
	Reference bit is 1:
		Change reference bit to 0
		move to next oldest, i.e. Repeat with next oldest
Repeat

To do things faster:
If all the frames referenced:
	change all references to 0
	remove the oldest reference
```
