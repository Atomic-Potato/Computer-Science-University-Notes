`Flyweight` is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by **sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.** It is used when you need to create a large number of similar objects. 

So to reduce memory usage you share Objects that are similar in some way rather than creating new ones.

_For example:_
Say you want to create 20 different circles with different colors and locations

# Problem
We are going to create a `Shape` interface and concrete class `Circle` implementing the Shape interface.
![[Pasted image 20230122154331.png|150]]

```java
public interface Shape {
	void draw();
}
```

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {
	private String color;
	private int x;
	private int y;
	private int radius;
	
	public Circle(String color){
		this.color = color;
	}
	public void setX(int x) {
		this.x = x;
	}
	public void setY(int y) {
		this.y = y;
	}
	public void setRadius(int radius) {
		this.radius = radius;
	}
	@Override
	public void draw() {
		System.out.println("Circle: Draw() [Color : " + color + ", x : " + x + 
							", y :" + y + ", radius :" + radius);
	}
}
```

Now we're gonna create a demo class to represent the problem of which we create 20 circles without conserving memory.
```java
public class Demo {
	private static final String colors[] = {"Red", "Green", "Blue", "Black",
											"White"};
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for(int i=0; i < 20; ++i) {
			Circle circle = new Circle(color [(int(Math.random()*colors.length)]);
			circle.setX(Math.random()*100);
			circle.setY(Math.random()*100);
			circle.setRadius(Math.random()*100);
			circle.draw();
		}
	}
}
```

# Solution
Flyweight pattern tries to **reuse already existing similar kind objects** by storing them and creates new object when no matching object is found.

A `flyweight` is an object through which we try to minimize memory usage by sharing data as much as possible.

Two common terms are used here:
- `intrinsic state` : The constant data of an object, i.e. not public and can only be read _(color in this case)_
- `extrinsic state` : The data and variables that can be accessed and altered _(size and position in this case)_

The first category _(intrinsic)_ can be stored in the `flyweight` and is **shareable**. The other one depends on the `flyweight`â€™s context and is **non-shareable**.

## Example Solution

In the circles example, we have the color as an intrinsic state, while the other variables are extrinsic. So we can group the circles by colors

- `ShapeFactory` has a `HashMap` of `Circle` having key as color _(intrinsic state)_ of the `Circle` object.  Whenever a request comes to create a circle of particular color to `ShapeFactory`, it checks the circle object in its `HashMap`, **if object of Circle found, that object is returned otherwise a new object is created**, stored in `hashmap` for future use, and returned to client.
- `FlyWeightPatternDemo`, our execution class, will use `ShapeFactory` to get a `Shapeobject`. It will pass information _(red / green / blue/ white/ black)_ to `ShapeFactory` to get the circle of desired color it needs.

### Implementation

# Structure
![[Pasted image 20230122160233.png|700]]
- The `Flyweight Factory` manages a pool of existing flyweights. With the factory, client donâ€™t create flyweights directly. Instead, they call the factory, passing it bits of e intrinsic state of the desired flyweight. **The factory looks over previously created flyweights and either returns an existing one that matches search criteria or creates a new one if nothing is found.**
- The `Flyweight` class contains the portion of the original objectâ€™s state that can be shared between multiple objects. The same flyweight object can be used in many different contexts. The state stored inside a flyweight is called intrinsic. The state passed to the flyweightâ€™s methods is called extrinsic.
