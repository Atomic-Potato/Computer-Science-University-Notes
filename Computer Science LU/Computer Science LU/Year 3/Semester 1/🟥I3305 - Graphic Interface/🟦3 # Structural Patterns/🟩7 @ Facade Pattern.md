`Facade` is a structural design pattern that **provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.**

 A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.
