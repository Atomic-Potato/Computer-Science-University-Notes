`Bridge` pattern decouples an **abstraction** from its **implementation** so that the two can vary independently.

In this pattern, the `abstract class` is separated from the `implementation class` and we provide a bridge `interface` between them. This interface helps us to make concrete class functionalities independent from the interface implementer class. We can modify these different kind of classes structurally without affecting each other.

# Problem

>- Remote is an abstract class. It contains:
>	â€¢ an instance variable sound
>	â€¢ methods **soundUp** and **soundDown**
>	â€¢ two abstract methods **onPressMiddle** and **onPressNine**
>- If it is remote for TV: **onPressNine** > go to the channel nine.
>- remote for DVD: **onPressNine** > pause.
>- Sony remote: **onPressMiddle** > open menu.
>- If it is Toshiba remote: **onPressMiddle** > turn off.

The problem with this implementation is if we wanted to add a new type, say LCD. Then we have to create three new data types _(RemoteLCD, RemoteLCDSony, RemoteLCDToshiba)_. **Which will result in methods duplication / code redundancy.**  And we hate that cuz its annoying.

# Solution

The `Bridge` pattern attempts to solve this problem by **switching from inheritance to the object composition.** What this means is that you extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class.
