Interviews reveal information about:
- Opinions
- Feelings
- Goals
- Key HCI concerns

# Interview preparation
These are the requirements to be prepared for an interview:
- Reading background material
- Establishing interview objectives
- Deciding whom to interview
- Preparing the interviewee
- Deciding on question types and structure

# Question types
We have 2 types of questions:

## Open-ended
Open-ended interview questions allow the interviewed to respond how they wish, and to what length they wish. They are appropriate when the analyst is interested in breadth and depth of reply.

### Advantages
- Puts the interviewee at ease
- Allows the interviewer to pick up on the interviewed vocabulary
- Provides richness of detail
- Reveals avenues of further questioning that may have gone untapped

### Disadvantages
- May result in too much irrelevant detail
- Possibly losing control of the interview
- May take too much time for the amount of useful information gained
- Potentially seeming that the interviewer is unprepared

### Examples

## Closed
Closed interview questions limit the number of possible responses. They are appropriate for generating precise, reliable data that is easy to analyze.

### Advantages
- Saving interview time
- Easily comparing interviews
- Getting to the point
- Keeping control of the interview
- Covering a large area quickly
- Getting to relevant data

### Disadvantages
- Failure to obtain rich detailing
- Missing main ideas

### Bipolar
Bipolar questions are those that may be answered with a _‚Äúyes‚Äù_ or _‚Äúno‚Äù_ or _‚Äúagree‚Äù_ or _‚Äúdisagree‚Äù_.

**Bipolar questions should be used sparingly.**

## Probes
Probing questions elicit more detail about previous questions.

The purpose of probing questions is:
- To get more meaning
- To clarify
- To draw out and expand on the interviewee‚Äôs point

**_Note:_** These questions may be either open-ended or closed

_Examples of probes:_

# Arranging questions
There are 3 structures for arranging questions:

## Pyramid Structure
This structure starts with closed questions and working toward open-ended questions _(Hence the pyramid structure)_

This structure is useful if the interviewed needs to be warmed up to the topic or seem reluctant to address the topic

_Example:_

## Funnel
Like the pyramid structure but in reverse _(Just like a funnel)_ . It starts with open-ended questions and working toward closed questions.

This structure provides an easy, nonthreatening way to begin an interview. It is also useful when the interviewee feels emotionally about the topic.

_Now this one is from me, so take it with a grain of salt:_ I think it may be useful when its hard to detect the problem so we start with broad questions and keep narrowing it down to find the actual problem. But this doesnt really work since these questions may be static and i dont these might be useful to get requirements, but eh idk.

_Example:_

## Diamond
Starting with closed, moving toward open-ended, and ending with closed questions.

Its basically combining the `Pyramid` and the `Funnel` structures. Its a whole package, but takes a longer time

_Example:_

# The interview report
The report should be done as soon as possible. It starts with a summary then more details. And finally it is reviewed with the respondent.
