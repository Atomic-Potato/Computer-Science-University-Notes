# Listen to Customers (and Users)
Start by listening to the customers.

Learn as much as you can about **the problem they are trying to address** and **any ideas** they may have about how the application might solve that problem.

Focus as much as possible **on the problem**, not on the customer's suggested solutions, so you can **keep the requirements flexible**.

If the customers insist on a particular feature that you think is unimportant, ask them **why they want it.**

Take **lots of notes** while you‚Äôre listening to the customers.

# Use the Five Ws (and One H)
- `Who` : Ask who will be using the software and get to know as much as you can about those people.
	_users and customers are the same ?_
- `What` : Figure out what the customers need the application to do.
	_Focus on the goals as much as possible¬† rather than the customers‚Äô ideas about how the solution should work._
- `When` : Find out when the application is needed.
	_If the application will be rolled out in phases, find out which features are needed when._
- `Where`: Find out where the application will be used. Will it be used on desktop computers in an airconditioned office? Or will it be used on phones in a noisy subway?
- `Why` : use the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù question to help clarify the customers‚Äô needs and see if it is real.
	_Sometimes, customers don‚Äôt have a well-organized reason for building a new system. They just think it will help but don‚Äôt actually know why._
- `How` : you shouldn‚Äôt completely ignore the customers‚Äô ideas.
 _Sometimes, customers have good ideas, particularly if they relate to existing practices._

# [[üü©1 @ Requirements Engineering#^elicitation|Elicitation]] Problems
- `Rare explicit knowledge:`
	- Almost never written down
	- distributed knowledge across many sources/people
	- Conflicts of data between the different sources
- `Knowledge is tacit(silent):`
	- Hard to describe knowledge that is regularly used
- `Limited observability:`
	- Customer or user don‚Äôt have time to sit and talk
	- Analyst sometimes come and observe the company‚Äôs but because they know they're being studied they start changing their behavior, making the study inconsistent
- `Information may be biased:` _(which leads to different outcome)_
	- Might not tell you what you need to know
	- The client may have a hidden agenda (either consciously or unconsciously) that shows a different picture from the real one

## Traditional Techniques For [[üü©1 @ Requirements Engineering#^elicitation|Elicitation]]
- `Background Reading:` collecting data _(such as company reports, organizational charts, policy manuals, job descriptions, documentation of existing systems, etc.)_ to become familiar with the organization before making an interview.
	**The problem** with this is that the documentation may be out of sync with reality, long and contain irrelevant details
- `Hard data & samples:`  Choosing which hard data to collect and for which sample of the population we want to collect the hard data _(hard data includes forms, invoices, financial information, survey results, marketing data, etc.)_
- `Interviews:` Can be structured (pre-set agenda) or open-ended questions (more like a conversation) and they give us a good amount of information through onions and follow up questions.
	**The problem** with interviews is that they require a lot of experience and spatial awareness. And its not really enough to collect a lot of information.
- `Surveys:` They collect a large amount of data quickly and can be administered remotely _(via email or web)_
	**The problem** with surveys is that they severely constraint the information the user can provide and we might miss unforeseen relevant data.
- `Meetings:` Used for summarization of finding & collection of feedback to confirm or refute what have been learned. They are fundamental, have a clear-stated objective & final-stating requirements.
