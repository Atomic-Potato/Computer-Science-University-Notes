SRS documents are a way to communicate requirements to others. And different projects require different SRSs _(for example a project between 3 devs can have an informal SRS, however when teams get larger the SRS needs to be a fairly complex document)_ 

# SRS Common Format: IEEE _(EEEEEEEEEE, nah jk just 3 Es)_
- `Introduction:` Discusses these points about the project
	- Purpose
	- Context
	- Objectives
- `User Requirements`
- `System Requirements:` ([[游릴3 @ Requirement Categories#^functionalRequirements|Functional]] and [[游릴3 @ Requirement Categories#^nonFunctionalRequirements|Non-Functional]]) 

## User Requirements Properties (Reminder)
- `Simple` (not compound): Expresses one piece of functionality that the system should provide
- `Testable`
- `Organized`
- `Numbered` (for traceability)
