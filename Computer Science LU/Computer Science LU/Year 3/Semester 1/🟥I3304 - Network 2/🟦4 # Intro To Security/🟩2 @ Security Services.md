Security services enhance security of data processing systems and information transfers of an organization.

These services often replicates functions normally associated with physical documents _(for example having a signature or a date)_

# Basic Security Services
- `Authentication:` Assurance that the communicating entity is the one it claims to be. 
  - Peer entity authentication, i.e. mutual confidence in the identities of the parties involved in a connection
  - Data-origin authentication.
- `Access Control:` prevention of the unauthorized use of a resource
- `Data Confidentiality:` protection of data from unauthorized disclosure _(against eavesdropping)_
- `Data Integrity:` assurance that data received are exactly as sent by an authorized sender
- `Non-Repudiation:` protection against denial by one of the parties in a communication.
	- Origin non-repudiation: proof that the message was sent by the specified party.
	- Destination non-repudiation: proof that the message was received by the specified party
- `Availability:` The property of a system or a system resource being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized system entity

_A better explanation than in the course:_
1.  `Authentication`: This refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or device. It ensures that only authorized users or entities are granted access to resources or sensitive data. Authentication can be done using various methods such as passwords, biometric identification, digital certificates, or smart cards.
    
2.  `Access Control:` This involves restricting access to resources or data based on the user's identity or authorization level. Access control can be implemented at different levels such as physical access control, network access control, or application-level access control. It helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.
    
3.  `Data Confidentiality:` This refers to the protection of data from unauthorized disclosure. It involves encrypting data so that it can only be read by authorized users or systems. Confidentiality can be achieved using various encryption techniques such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, or hashing.
    
4.  `Data Integrity:` This refers to the assurance that data has not been tampered with or altered during transmission or storage. Data integrity ensures that the data remains accurate, complete, and consistent over time. It can be achieved using various techniques such as digital signatures, message authentication codes (MAC), or checksums.
    
5.  `Non-Repudiation:` This refers to the assurance that a party cannot deny the authenticity or integrity of a message or transaction that they have sent or received. Non-repudiation is achieved by using digital signatures or other cryptographic techniques that provide evidence of the authenticity and integrity of the message or transaction.
    
6.  `Availability`: This refers to the ability of a system or service to remain operational and accessible to authorized users even in the face of attacks or failures. Availability can be ensured through various means such as redundancy, fault-tolerant design, and disaster recovery planning. Ensuring availability is critical for critical systems or services that need to be operational 24/7.
