# Aspects of Information Security
There are 3 aspects of information security:

## Security Attack
A security attack is any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.

Information security is about how to prevent attacks, or failing that, to detect attacks on information-based systems.

There are 2 generic types of attacks:
- `Passive`
- `Active`

### Passive Attacks
Basically just intercepting messages.

The attacker can:
- Read the content
- Traffic analysis

They are hard to detect/prevent.

### Active Attacks
The attacker actively manipulates the communication.

The attacker can:
- Masquerade: pretend as someone else
- Fabrication: create a bogus message
- Replay: passively capture data and send later
- Denial-of-service: prevention the normal use of servers, end users, or network itself
- deny: repudiate sending/receiving a message later 
- modification: change the content of a message
