# Designing Software
## Functional Decomposition
`Top-down`, approach, classic in engineering
- Proceed by decomposition of the main function of the software into sub-problems
-  Repeat the decomposition until you get basic sub problems that are easy to solving it

### Problems
- The software can have multiple main functions.
- In a functional view, with a time division (B then C‚Ä¶.), certain distinct parts are difficult to separate from each other, _(e.g. user interface / functional core)_
- Often leads to a specific decomposition, the elements of which are not very reusable

## Object-oriented Software Construction
It is a `bottom-up` process of building robust and extendible solutions to parts of the problem, and combining them into more and more powerful assemblies ‚Äî until the final assembly which yields a solution of the original problem

This method is `Extendable` and `Reusable` (a set of functions ‚Äúassociated with a type‚Äù is more reusable than an isolated function)

### Problems
- How to find the relevant object types.
- How to describe the relations between object types.
