Obviously a list is an ordered collection of selectable choices.

The key attributes of a list in XML:
![[Pasted image 20230308082952.png|600]]

# Static Lists
Static lists, as the name suggests, are content fixed and known before the app runs.

You have to declare the list elements in the `strings.xml` resource file.
```xml
<resources>
	<string-array name = "operating systems">
		<item>Android</item>
		<item>IOS</item>
		...
	</string-array>
</resources>
```

Adding the elements to your static list:
```xml
<ListView 
	... 
	android:id="@+id/mylist" 
	android:entries="@array/operating systems"/>
```

# Dynamic Lists
Dynamic lists, as the name suggests, content is read or generated as the program runs. _(Comes from a data file, or from the internet, etc.)_

**The new elements must be set in the Java code.**

# List Adapters
_Reminder: [[ðŸŸ©2 @ Spinners#^adapter|Adapters]]_ 
You can use those as like in [[ðŸŸ©2 @ Spinners]]. Just remember to use the `android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1` instead of the spinner layout.

_For example:_
```java
ArrayList<String> myArray = ...;

ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(
	this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, myArray);

ListView list = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.mylist);
list.setAdapter(myAdapter);
```

==NOTE:== if you make an adapter for an  `ArrayList` of a class that doesnt have a `toString()` that is **not overwritten** then you'll get some random stuff displayed in the `ListView`

# Lists Events
**Lists dont use `onClick` event**. The event listeners must be attached in the Java code, not in the XML.
For this we need to use Java **anonymous inner classes.** 

## Anonymous Inner Class
Basically they are a shorthand syntax for declaring a small class without giving it an explicit name.

Typically the class is declared and a single of it is constructed and used all at once.

We will see an example in the following heading.

## Attaching an event listener to an object
```java
Button button = ...;
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
	public void onClick(View v){
		// do ur thing
	}
})
```

## List Events
There are many list events, but we'll just cover the main ones:
- `setOnItemClickListener(AdapterView.OnItemClickListener):` Listener for when an item in the list has been clicked.
- `setOnItemLongClickListener(AdapterView.OnItemLongClickListener):` Listener for when an item in the list has been clicked and held.
- `setOnItemSelectedListener(AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener):`  Listener for when an item in the list has been selected _(more like highlighted if that helps)_.

_For example:_

## Deleting Entries (in dynamic lists)
If you are trying to modify the data array  data in an anonymous class, then you have to do either one of these to update the list:
- Create a new array adapter:
	```java
	data.remove(position);  
	ArrayAdapter ar = new ArrayAdapter(Lists.this, R.layout.support_simple_spinner_dropdown_item, data);  
	list.setAdapter(ar);
	```
- Get a reference to the adapter and notify it
	```java
	((BaseAdapter) list.getAdapter()).notifyDataSetChanged();
	```
- Make the adapter global and notify it 

# Custom List Layouts
To make a custom list:
1. Write a short layout XML file describing the layout for each row.
2. Write a subclass of `ArrayAdapter` that overrides `getView()` to describe what view must be returned for each row.
