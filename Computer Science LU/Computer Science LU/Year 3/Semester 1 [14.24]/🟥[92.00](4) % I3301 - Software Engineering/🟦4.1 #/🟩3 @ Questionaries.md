Questionnaires are useful in gathering information from key organization members about:
- `Attitudes`
- `Beliefs`
- `Behaviors`
- `Characteristics`

There should be first some planning before using questionaries, since:
- Organization members are widely dispersed.
- Many members are involved with the project.

# Writing questions
Questions in a questionary are either:
- `Open-ended`
- `Closed`

## Questionnaire Language
- Simple
- Specific
- Short
- Not patronizing
- Free of bias
- Addressed to those who are knowledgeable
- Technically accurate
- Appropriate for the reading level of the respondent

# Using scales
There are 2 different forms of measurement scales:

## Nominal
Nominal scales are used to classify things. _(It is the weakest form of measurement)_. Data may be totaled.

_Example:_

## Interval
An interval scale is used when the intervals are equal. _(There is no absolute zero.)_

_Example:_

## Validity & Reliability
`Reliability` of scales refers to consistency in response. Which means you should be getting the same results if the same questionnaire was administered again under the same conditions.

`Validity` is the degree to which the question measures what the analyst intends to measure.

# Design
This section talks mostly about the looks and not the questions themself.

In a questionnaire, you should:
- Allow ample white space. _(Ample: enough, more than enough, plentiful)_
- Allow ample space to write or type in responses.
- Make it easy for respondents to clearly mark their answers.
- Be consistent in style.

## Order of Questions
- Place most important questions first.
- Cluster items of similar content together.
- Introduce less controversial questions first.

## Designing a Web Survey
When designing a web survey, keep in mind that there are different ways to capture responses:

# Administering
Methods of administering the questionnaire:
- Convening _(bring together for a meeting/activity)_ all concerned respondents together at one time
- Personally administering the questionnaire
- Allowing respondents to self-administer the questionnaire
- Mailing questionnaires
- Administering over the Web or via email
