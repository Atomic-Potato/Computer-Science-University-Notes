# FAQ
- **What is a software:**
	Computer programs and associated documents. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or for a general market
- **What are the attributes of a good software:**
	Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and useable
- **What is software engineering:**
	Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production
- **What are the fundamental software engineering activities:**
	Software specification, software dev, software validation and software evolution
- **What is the difference between software engineering and CS:**
	Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals, software engineering is connected with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software
- **What is the difference between SE and system engineering:**
	System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based system development including hardware, software and process engineering.
	Software engineering is part of this more general process.
- **What are the key challengers facing software engineering:**
	Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery times and developing relatable software
- **What are the costs of software engineering:**
	roughly 60% of software costs are development costs. 40% are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs.
# Essential attributes
- `Maintainability`
- `Dependability & Security`
- `Efficiency`
- `Acceptability` (Software must be acceptable to the users it was made for. Such as making it compatible with as many operating systems)
# Application types
- `Stand alone` applications:
	Apps that run on a local computer. No need to connect to a network.
- `Interactive transaction-based` applications:
	Any application accessed and used from a remote PC. AKA **web applications**
- `Embedded control` systems:
	Software control systems that control and manage hardware devices.
- `Batch (Collection) processing` systems
	Business systems that are designed to process data in large batches
- `Entertainment` systems
	What's up gamers. Today we playing Minecraft.
- Systems for `modeling and simulation`.
	Like Blender
- `Data collection` systems
	Systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing
- `Systems of systems`

# Causes of software crisis
- Increasing product complexity
- Slow programmersâ€™ productivity growth
	Maybe employees have to learn a new language/framework to develop a product
- Lack of funding for software engineering research (small cause)
- Rising demand for software
