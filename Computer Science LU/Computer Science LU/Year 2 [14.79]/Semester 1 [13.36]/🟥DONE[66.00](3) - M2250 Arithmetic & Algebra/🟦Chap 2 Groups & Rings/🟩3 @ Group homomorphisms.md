# Definitions
**`Def 1 (no homo):`**
Let (G,∗), (G',⊥) be two groups of neutral elements e and e' . A mapping f : G --> G' is said to be group homomorphism if, for all x,y ∈ G, we have $$f(x ∗ y) = f(x)⊥f(y)$$
A mapping is `endomorphism` is a homo mapping from G to itself
A mapping is `automorphism` <==> homo + bijective
**`Def 2:`**
- **Kernel:** $ker(f) = {x ∈ G/ : f(x) = e'} [= f^{−1}({e'})]$
- **image:** $Im(f) = {f(x)/ : x ∈ G} [= f(G)]$

# Propositions
**`Prop 1:`**
f : G --> G' be a group homomorphism, where e,e' are the neutral elements of G and G' respectively then
- *f(e) = e'*
- $f(x^{−1}) = f(x)^{−1} ,∀x ∈ G$

**`Prop 2:`**
ker(f) is normal subgroup of G and Im(f) = f(G) is subgroup of G'
