# Theorems
-  **Theorem 1** Let A `!= empty` be subset of N then, A is upper bounded, if and only if, A has greatest element.
-  **Theorem 2** For every `(a,b) ∈ N × N*` , there is a unique pair of natural integers `(q,r) ∈N × N` such that, `a = b*q + r` and `0 ≤ r < b`.
	-  **Corollary** If (a,b) ∈ Z × Z*, then there is a unique pair of integers `(q,r) ∈ Z × Z` such that, `a = bq + r` and `0 ≤ r < |b|`.

# Definitions
- **Definition 1** When `r = 0` in the corollary of Theorem 2 above, we say that b divides a and we write `b | a`.
- **Definition 2** A positive integer `p` is said to be `prime` number if `the only divisors of p are 1 and p`.
Note that the prime numbers are >= 2.
- **Definition 3** `p` is `!prime` iff `p = a*b` such that `1 < a or b < p`.

# Properties
- **Prop 1:** Let n>=2 and *p* a prime number then if `p|n!+1` then `p >= n`
- **Prop 2:** a <= b ==> a | b!
- **Prop 3:** if `x|y` and `x|z` then x divides any linear combination of y and z (for example, y+z, y - z, y - 2z)
- **Prop 4:** if n is an integer then there exists a prime number p that divides n

# Notes
- prime numbers are >= 2
