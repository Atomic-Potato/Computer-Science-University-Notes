## Ex 1
Three fair dice are rolled repeatedly until the sum of their up faces exceed 16. Find the expected number of rolling needed:

You have 2 outcomes, 666 (1 time) or 665 (3 times)
The the probability of success is:
$p = \frac{4}{6^3}$
And so the expected value is:
$E(X) = \frac{6^3}{4}$

## Ex 2
A certain basketball player makes a foul shot with probability 0.45. Find the probability that his second basket occur between the eight and the tenth shot.

We have 0.55 in and 0.45 out.

Let  X be the nb of shots until the second basked occur
NB(r=2, p=0.55)
