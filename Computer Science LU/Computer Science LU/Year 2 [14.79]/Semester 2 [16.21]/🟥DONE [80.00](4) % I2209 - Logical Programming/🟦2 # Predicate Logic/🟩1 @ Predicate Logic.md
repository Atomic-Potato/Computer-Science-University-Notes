# Intro
`Propositional logic` is rather limited in its expressive power. *(E.g., ‚ÄùFor every x, x > 0‚Äù is true if x is a positive integer. Cannot be expressed in propositional logic)*

To deal with that we have `Predicates` and `Quantifiers`:
- A `predicate`  is a property about some objects or a relationship among objects represented by variables ^predicate
- A `Quantifier` tell how many objects has a certain property ^quantifier

# Predicate logic vocabulary
- `Constants` (a, b, c, 5, socrates, ...) ^constants
- `Functors or Functions` (f , g, h, +/2, mother/1, ...) ^functorsOrFunctions
- `Predicate symbols` (P, Q, R, Mother/1, < /2, ...) ^predicateSymbols
- `Variables` (x, y, z, x 1 , x 2 , ...) ^variables
- `Logical Connectives` (¬¨, ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚Üí, ‚Üî) ^logicalConnectives
- `Quantifiers` (‚àÄ, ‚àÉ) ^quantifiers
- `Parenthesis`

*Example: A = {volvo; owner/1; owns/2; happy/1}*

# Terms
Let A be a `vocabulary`.
A `term` in a is:
- Every constant in A is a term;
- Every variable is a term;
- If f /n is a functor in A and t 1 , ..., t n are terms over A then f (t 1 , ..., t n ) is a term

A `term` that contains no variables is called a `ground term` ^groundTerm

# Well-Formed Formula
Let A be a `vocabulary`.
The set of all `formulas` over A is the least set such that:
- If p/n is a predicate symbol in A and t 1 , ..., t n are terms then p(t 1 , ..., t n ) is an `atomic formula` ^atomicFormula
- If F and G are formulas, then ¬¨F, (F ‚àß G), (F ‚à® G), (F ‚Üí G) and (F ‚Üî G) are formulas
- If F is a formula and x a variable, then ‚àÄx F and ‚àÉx F are formulas.

# Bound and free variables
An occurrence of x in a formula is said to be `free` iff the occurrence does not follow immediately after a `quantifier`, or in a formula immediately after `‚àÄx or ‚àÉx`, otherwise, the variable is `bound` (A variable in a wff is said to be `bound` if it is quantified). 

A formula that does not contain any [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#Bound and free variables|free]] occurrences of variables is said to be `closed`. ^closed

The effect/`scope` of a quantifier, is indicated by square brackets `[ ]`, If there are no square brackets, then the scope is understood to be the smallest `wff` following the quantification. ^scope

# Universal & Existential Closure
- Assume that **{x 1 ,...,x n }** are the only `free` occurrences of variables in a formula F. The `universal` closure **‚àÄF of F** is the closed formula **‚àÄx 1 ...‚àÄx n F**.
- The `existential` closure ‚àÉF is defined similarly.

# Substitution and Instantiation
The `substitution` operation consists of replacing some free `variables` of a formula **F** by `terms`.
Let **F** be a formula where **x 1 ,...,x n** are `free` variables and `œÉ` the `substitution` **{x 1 /t 1 ,...,x n /t n }.**
$F_œÉ$ is the formula obtained by replacing all the free occurrence of $x_i$ by $t_i .$

A substitution `instantiates` a variable **x** if it **replaces x by a term that does not contain any variable.**

# Interpretations
Let A be a vocabulary. An `interpretation` I of A consists of:
- A non-empty set D (often written |I|) of objects (the domain of I)
- A function that maps:
	- Every constant c in A on an element $\color{cyan} c_I$ in D
	- Every functor f /n in A on a function $\color{cyan} f_I$ : $D^n$ ‚Üí D
	- Every predicate symbol p/n in A on a relation $\color{cyan} p_I ‚äÜ D n$

*Example: (what... ?)*

# Interpretation VS Valuation
- An `interpretation` defines how to interpret constants, functors and predicates symbols but it **does not say what a variable denotes.**
- A `valuation` is a function from variables to objects in the domain of an interpretation.

# The interpretation of terms
Let I be an interpretation of a vocabulary A and œÉ be a valuation. The interpretation $\color{cyan} œÉ_I (t)$ of the term t is an object in t‚Äôs domain:
- If t is a constant c then $\color{cyan} œÉ_I (t) = c_I$
- If t is a variable x then $\color{cyan} œÉ_I (t) = œÉ(x)$
- If t is a term f (t 1 ,...,t n ) then $\color{cyan} œÉ_I (t) = f_I (œÉ_I (t_1 ),...,œÉ_I (t_n ))$.

# The interpretation of formulas
The meaning of a formula is a truth-value` ‚Äùtrue‚Äù or ‚Äùfalse‚Äù.`
Given an interpretation I and a valuation œÉ we write:

# Models & Consistency
 
Let F be a [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#^closed |closed]] formula, P be a set of [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#^closed |closed]] formulas.
- An interpretation I is a `model` of F iff **I |= F**
- An interpretation I is a `model` of P iff **I is a model of every formula in P**

F (resp. P) is `consistent` iff F (resp. P) **have at least one model.** (Otherwise F/P is `inconsistent`)

F is `valid` iff **for all interpretation I we have I |= F**

# Logical Consequence
Reminder: [[üü©1 @ Propositional Logic#Tautology and logical Consequence | Logical Consequence]]

F is a `Logical consequence` of P (P |= F) iff F is true in all of P‚Äôs models (Mod(P) ‚äÜ Mod(F))

- **Theorem:** P |= F iff P ‚àß ¬¨F is `inconsistent` **`IMPORTANT`**

# Logical Equivalence
Let F, G, ‚àÄxH(x) be formulas. F and G are logically equivalent (F ‚â° G) iff I |= œÉ F exactly when I |= œÉ G.

# Prenex normal form (PNF)
- $\large Q_1x_1 \space Q_2 x_2 ... Q_n x_n \space M(x_1 x_2 ...x_n )$
	- [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#^quantifier|The qunatifier part:]] $\large Q_1x_1 \space Q_2 x_2 ... Q_n x_n$ Prefix($Q_ix_i = ‚àÄx_i \space or \space ‚àÉx_i$)
	- $M(x_1 x_2 ...x_n )$: Mantissa ([[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#Well-Formed Formula|wff]] without quantifier)
*Example:*
*‚àÄx‚àÉy(p(x,y) ‚Üí (q(x) ‚à® r(y)))*

## Converting to a pnf formula **`(IMPORTANT)`**
- replace `A ‚Üî B` by `(A ‚Üí B) ‚àß (B ‚Üí A)`
- replace `A ‚Üí B` by `¬¨A ‚à® B`
- Negation:
	- `¬¨¬¨F` by `F`
	- `¬¨‚àÄxF(x)` by `‚àÉx¬¨F(x)`
	- `¬¨‚àÉxF(x)` by `‚àÄx¬¨F(x)`

Apply all the other rules (rename if necessary)

# Skolem form (sf)
First we take a formula in [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#Prenex normal form PNF |PNF]] and we apply the following algorithm
- Let $\large Q_m$ be the 1st ‚àÉ (the + to left)
	- if theres no ‚àÄ before $\large Q_m$ ‚áí replace $\large x_m$ in Mantissa by a constant symbol not yet used (a,b,...)
	- else ‚áí choose a function symbol not yet used (f ,g,...) and replace $\large x_m$ in Mantissa by $\large f (x_1 ,x_2 ,...,x_{m‚àí1} )$
	_So for example if we have: for all X for all Y there is Z, we replace Z in the formula by f(X,Y)_
- Repeat till the elimination of all ‚àÉ
- Eliminate ‚àÄ (that becomes implicit)

# Clausal form
- Clause = disjunction of literals
- Literal = [[üü©1 @ Predicate Logic#^atomicFormula|atom]] or negation of an atom
- Clausal form = set (conjunction) of clauses
- Proposition
If, before transformation, F = F 1 ‚àß F 2 ‚àß ... ‚àß F n Then the clausal form $\large S_F = S_F1 ‚à™ S_F2 ‚à™ ... ‚à™ S_Fn$

## `Proving validity with clausal from`
Skolem maintain the inconsistency
F valid ‚áî ¬¨F inconsistent ‚áî pnf (¬¨F) inconsistent ‚áî sf (¬¨F) ‚áî clausal form (¬¨F) inconsistent

# Translate English to WFFs
Transcribing English sentences into `wffs` is sometimes non-trivial task. We just give a few examples:
- E stands for even and O stands for odd.
- **‚ÄùSome integers are even and some are odd‚Äù** can be translated as `‚àÉxE(x) ‚àß ‚àÉyO(y)`
- **‚ÄùNo integer is even‚Äù** `‚àÄx¬¨E(x)`
- **‚ÄùIf an integer is not even, then it is odd‚Äù** `‚àÄx[¬¨E(x) ‚Üí O(x)]`
- We assume that the universe is the set of integers. However, if we do not assume that, then we need to narrow it down using ‚àß, ‚Üí, and I (predicate for integer).
*E.g.: ‚àÉx[I(x) ‚àß E(x)] ‚àß ‚àÉy[I(y) ‚àß O(y)] ‚àÄx[I(x) ‚Üí ¬¨E(x)]*
