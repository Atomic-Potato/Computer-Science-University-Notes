# Definitions
**`Def 1: (Subrings)`**
We say H is subring of A if for all x,y ∈ H, we have **`x − y ∈ H`** and **`x.y ∈ H`**.

**`Def 2: (Ideal)`**
I is ideal, if and only if, for every x,y ∈ I and α ∈ A, we have **`x − y ∈ I`** and **`αx ∈ I`**.

**`Def 3: (Prince Ideal)`**
Let (A,+,.) be a ring and I is a non empty subset in A.
- I is the `principal ideal` of A if `I=Ax` for some x in A.
- A is said to be `principal ideal domain (PID)` if its integral and every ideal in A is principal.

# Propositions
**`Prop 1:`**
Let (A,+,.) be a ring with one and I is ideal in A.
- If `$1_A$ ∈ I` then `I=A`
- If in I there exists and invertible element then `I=A`

Corollary:
Let A be a ring with one. The following statements are equivalent:
- A is field
- - The only ideals of A are {0} and A
