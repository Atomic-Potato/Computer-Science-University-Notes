# Definitions
**`Def 1 (Ring):`**
Let A be a non empty set. A is said to be ring if it is defined with two binary operations: The addition and the multiplication. It will be denoted as (A,+,.) and satisfies the following properties:
-  (A,+) is an abelian group.
- The binary operation . is associative
- The binary operation . is distributive with respect to +, That is: a,b,c ∈ A we have: a(b + c) = ab + ac and (a + b)c = ac + bc.
And finally, A is commutative if `.` is commutative

**`Def 2 (Integral):`**
A is integral <==> For all **x,y** ∈ A, if **xy** = 0 then x = 0 or y = 0 <==> For all x,y ∈ A, if x != 0 and y != 0 then xy != 0.

**`Def 3 (Field):`**
A field is **a commutative ring with identity (1 ≠ 0) in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse**.

# Propositions
**`Prop 1:`**
Let (A,+,.) be a ring. The following statements hold.
-  a.0 = 0.a = 0 for every a ∈ A.
-  a(−b) = (−a)b = −ab for all a,b ∈ A.
-  a(b − c) = ab − ac and (b − c)a = ba − ca for all a,b,c ∈ A.
