## Useful functions
- `type(x)` gives us the type of a value / identifier

## Other notes
- A variable name such as x is called an identifier, we cant put a number at the start and capital and lowercase characters are different 


### Docstrings
Each script should start with a docstring that explains the script’s purpose. For more complex scripts, the docstring often spans many lines.

### Suite indetation
Python requires you to indent the statements in suites (or 4 spaces). You’ll see that incorrect indentation can cause errors.

### Objects and Dynamic typing
Values such as 7 (an integer), 4.1 (a floating point number) and 'dog' are all objects. Every object has a type and a value. An object’s value is the data stored in the object.
Assigning an object to a variable *binds* (associates) that variable’s name to the object.

### Python keywords
The words `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `True` and `False` are Python keywords. Using a keyword as an identifier such as a variable name is a syntax error.

### values with if statements
all values other than 0 are true statemens

### +=
you can use `+=` and such like in c and c#
