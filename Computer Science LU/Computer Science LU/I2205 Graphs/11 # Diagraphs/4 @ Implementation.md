 # Topological Sort
 a **topological sort** or **topological ordering** of a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") is a [linear ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") of its [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") such that for every directed edge _uv_ from vertex _u_ to vertex _v_, _u_ comes before _v_ in the ordering.
