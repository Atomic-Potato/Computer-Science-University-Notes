# Declaring something is `so and so`  using 「だ」
Theres "to-be" verbs in japanese. But to declare that **something is** we attach the character **「だ」** to the `noun` or `na-adjective` **only.**

*Example:*
- 人だ＝人+だ＝is person

Sometimes depending on the context theres no need to use 「だ」.
Like in greetings:
- 元気？(Are you) well?
- 元気。well.

# Conjugating to the `negative` state-of-being
In Japanese, negative and past tense are all expressed by conjugation. 
We can conjugate a noun or adjective to either its negative or past tense to say that **something is not [X]** or that **something was [X]**

Attatch `「じゃない」`to the `noun or na-adjective` for negative. 

_Example:_
- 学生じゃない not student

# Conjugating to the `past` state-of-being
To say something **was** something, attach `「だった」` to the `noun or na-adjective.`

In order to say the **negative past (was not)**, conjugate the negative to the negative past tense by **dropping** the `「い」` from 「じゃない」 and **adding** `「かった」`.

_Example:_
- 友達だった was friend
- 友達じゃなかった wasnt friend
