# Computer Science University notes

I use this `obsidian`  vault mainly for my uni notes, feel free to use them if you need to. 
They are pretty much summary of the topics in a nice clean way.
Just make sure you got obsidian installed.

Plus theres the vaults "日本語" and "Game Dev" which are just my personal interests notes. 
I was just lazy to remove them from here since i was just making this public for my friends and i doubt they will be any use to anyone.
