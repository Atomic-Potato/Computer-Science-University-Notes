# Computer Science University notes

I use this `obsidian`  vault mainly for my uni notes, feel free to use them if you need to. 
They are pretty much summary of the topics in a nice clean way.
The vault contains notes `from the second year` and will keep getting updated until i graduate.
If you like you can upload the notes for the first year and ill apply the changes. _(sorry i was using Miro first year)_

Just make sure you got obsidian installed.

## How to setup
- Download the project
- Download Obsidian
- Open Obsidian
- Click on open folder as vault
- Select the `Computer Science LU` folder
