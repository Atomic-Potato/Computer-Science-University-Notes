# Serious bugs
- [x] Player can only start jumping once he first aims at one of the anchors
- [x] sometimes when youre grounded and you dash the end of the dash doesnt stop and keeps the momentum of the dash
- [x] sometimes when you grapple and dash afterwards, it wont let you grapple again for some reason (it wasnt because of the dash, it was because of your stupid ass made 2 delay timers for grappling for some weird reason)
- [ ] Companion sprite flipping
- [x] dash count reduces by 2 sometimes
- [ ] sometimes the player doesnt dash after grappling

# Less serious bugs
- [x] The jump at the start of the game
