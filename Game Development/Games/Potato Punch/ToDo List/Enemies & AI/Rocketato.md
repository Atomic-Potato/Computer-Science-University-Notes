# Rocketato

## ToDo List
- [ ] Player doesnt restore control unless collided with an object, maybe when collided also give a small timer to give back control
- [ ] Rocket follows the player until it reaches a certain distance and then pauses and launches at the player with the last captured direction before the pause

## Optional
- [ ] You can ride the rocket if you get to it in the pausing phase, but it will blow up after some time
