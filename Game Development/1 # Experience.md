# Code
- Create a `boolean` variable for states an entity is currently in _(such as isMoving, isShooting etc.)_ this quite useful later on when making animations and audio effects]
- In prefabs that require a component that is inside the scene, use FindComponent();

# Audio
- `.WAV` is the best format for **Unity**
