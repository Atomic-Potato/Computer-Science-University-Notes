Remember, dont talk too much, its just a quick update of the roadmap

# Intro
Hello again, sorry for the big delay, it was out of my hand. You know, life happened. This video could have been out sooner unless for one thing that kept me waiting for month...
%%Insert internal screaming with slow battery image%%
%%Finish off with about 500ms of screen time with the explanation of what happened%%
But its no biggy we're back now. Before i start i wanna make clear that this video is not exactly a devlog but more like talking about the state of the game and what i wanna do.
Which is basically the definition of a devlog lmao. You'll know what i mean if you continue watching. %%x for doubt%%

Oh and whats that big ugly thing behind me?  Its just some human i enslaved to talk for me, quite surprisingly he has the same voice as mine. I'am using him because us potatoes have very low volume voices which are barely audible by human mics and i can't afford a potato mic now, but hey i can afford a human. 
Alright i dont wanna be rude, you can turn around human.
%%Turns around%%

# Starting over
Its been quite some time ive been "working" on this game, and if we look closely, it looks like garbage and i barely did anything substantial. It was a big pile of shit.
So i decided to start over and do it right this time, because now i have more experience, and i have a new plan of what i wanna do which i will tell you right now.
To not do the same mistake, ive cut down my expectations quite a lot:
So instead of having the huge map that i was making with multiple sublevels, its just gonna be a lot smaller with no sublevels.
I managed to get the slopes code but i dont understand it so i can barely edit it in the future so as well, no walking on slopes anymore, we got a basic movement that i can edit as i like, which leads us to the next thing.
No more grounded enemies, too much to code and still not advanced enough to do it.
Also we will only have 2 enemies, a flyer that shoots at you from afar and a rocket boy that goes nyooooom.
Make 32x32 pixel art instead of 100x100 which first caused some graphical issues and you couldnt see all the details, and it takes less time to draw and animate.
And these are my major points, im aming for simpler code with less bugs, and less time drawing.

# Whats next
To actually feel like we are making progress, each build of the game will be posted on discord %%link in description%%, currently the first build is on there, nothing much in it, its just the controller that ive been working on, i wont talk about it here so feel free to try it out yourself. Instead we're gonna talk about whats next, so as ive said i now know exactly what i want to do with this game, so we will hopefully have a constant stream of builds with new things to try out, the next build goal is to make the 2 enemy types. I'll keep doing this till the final release of the game, and about that, this release wont have the boss in it but that doesnt mean its canceled.
I decided to do this because it lowers the bar for me to actually polish and release an actual game because i have never finished a game before and this is the first game i started working on and i wont let it go cause im one stubborn motha fucker.

# End
Alright i didnt want to make this video too long, i just meant it to be as hey im back to work kind of video. Before i made this video i was planning on making a fully fledged video with a crazy script to glorify the little work i done, but as you can see its not really worth it. Anyways, most of the updates on the game will be on discord and i will try to make a new devlog once we got a bunch of stuff done to sum it up. Also twitch live streams are canceled sorry about that, tho ill do littol streams on discord every time im working on the game because they are easier to set up and lighter on my hardware.
Thats it for now thanks for making it to the end of the video. See you next year.
