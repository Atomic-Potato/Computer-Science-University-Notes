# Player
- Health can be a combo of regen and non regen
- Companion can heal player while standing still
- You can kill a flyer instantly if you dash into it, just hold shit and click to automatically dash into its direction

# Enemies
- Rocketato follows the player and the player can ride it (no homo) #rocketato
- Rolling over grounded enemies instantly / lowers their health significantly,
	and once you hit one the rolling key resets back to the top key of the roll curve to keep the roll going
	which will both keep the momentum and wont make the player stop in the middle of these guys #grounded-enemy
- After each wave the waves stop coming until the player decides to start them again
	This allows the player to take their time solving the puzzles around the world
	However solving a puzzle while waves are paused will not give the player any points #wave-system

# World
- Make puzzles that the player has to solve to unlock the boss fight
	This can be used to like supply the god with juice instead having to make a boring ass mini stand in one place #puzzle
- Puzzles are located inside shrines / new scenes so they would reset every time the player attempts them
	This prevents the players from almost solving, then starting the wave and solve it to get the bonus 
	Also this makes it that you have to spawn enemies inside the shrine #puzzle  
- The shrines reward are the new abilities (like grappling) #puzzle 
- If the player enters the shrine while the waves are started, make the wave endless until the player finishes the shrine
	In case the player finishes the shrine too quickly before killing the minimum amount of enemies in a wave
	Keep the wave after the player leaves the shrine #puzzle 
- Enemies at the shrines dont give points so player wouldnt grind them #puzzle 
- Let the game start from the tutorial, probably start off next to a beach, then the player encounters a lab inside a mountain
	The door of the lab explodes and a scientist bursts out fried in uranium, then you walk inside and do the tutorial and leave from the other side to start the main game #tutorial 
- In the tutorial introduce one of the enemies chained inside a room with its name above it and close the doors on the player once inside and make them fight it #tutorial 
- In each shrine after acquiring a new ability, make the player a small tutorial afterwards where they have to use this ability to get out of the shrine #tutorial #puzzle 
# Audio
- Make audio FX normal SFX + 8-bit

# Art
- Redesign the enemies to have robotic parts as well, name them with letters and numbers
- Some shrines have lights around them where the potato government tried to enter it while others are hidden inside forests #puzzle
