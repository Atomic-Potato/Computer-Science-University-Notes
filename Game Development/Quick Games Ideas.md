# Snake
Just like the old game snake, however a player controls the dot and a player controls the snake.
The dot can jump over the snake and has limited jumps. Each time he jumps successfully over the snake he gains back the jump.

The dot should survive until the timer ends, and as the time passes the snake grows.
